      "Bacterial evolution is characterized by strong purifying selection as well as rapid adaptive evolution in changing environments. In this context, the genomic GC content (genomic GC) varies greatly but presents some level of phylogenetic stability, making it challenging to explain based on current hypotheses. To illuminate the evolutionary mechanisms of the genomic GC, we analyzed the base composition and functional inventory of 11,083 representative genomes. A phylogenetically constrained bimodal distribution of the genomic GC, which mainly originated from parallel divergences in the early evolution, was demonstrated. Such variation of the genomic GC can be well explained by DNA replication and repair (DRR), in which multiple pathways correlate with the genomic GC. Furthermore, the biased conservation of various stress-related genes, especially the DRR-related ones, implies distinct adaptive processes in the ancestral lineages of high- or low-GC clades which are likely induced by major environmental changes. Our findings support that the mutational biases resulting from these legacies of ancient adaptation have changed the course of adaptive evolution and generated great variation in the genomic GC. This highlights the importance of indirect effects of natural selection, which indicates a new model for bacterial evolution. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> GC content has been shown to be an important factor in microbial ecology and evolution, and the genomic GC of bacteria can be characterized by great intergenomic heterogeneity, high intragenomic homogeneity, and strong phylogenetic inertia, as well as being associated with the environment. Current hypotheses concerning direct selection or mutational biases cannot well explain these features simultaneously. Our findings of the genomic GC showing that ancient adaptations have transformed the DRR system and that the resulting mutational biases further contributed to a bimodal distribution of it offer a more reasonable scenario for the mechanism. This would imply that, when thinking about the evolution of life, diverse processes of adaptation exist, and combined effects of natural selection should be considered.\n",
      "The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) allows the study of epigenetic regulation of gene expression by assessing chromatin configuration for an entire genome. Despite its popularity, there have been limited studies investigating the analytical challenges related to ATAC-seq data, with most studies leveraging tools developed for bulk transcriptome sequencing. Here, we show that GC-content effects are omnipresent in ATAC-seq datasets. Since the GC-content effects are sample specific, they can bias downstream analyses such as clustering and differential accessibility analysis. We introduce a normalization method based on smooth-quantile normalization within GC-content bins and evaluate it together with 11 different normalization procedures on 8 public ATAC-seq datasets. Accounting for GC-content effects in the normalization is crucial for common downstream ATAC-seq data analyses, improving accuracy and interpretability. Through case studies, we show that exploratory data analysis is essential to guide the choice of an appropriate normalization method for a given dataset.\n",

      "A genome's nucleotide composition can usually be summarized with (G)uanine + (C)ytosine (GC) or (A)denine + (T)hymine (AT) frequencies as GC% = 100% - AT%. Genomic AT/GC content has been linked to environment and selective processes in asexually reproducing organisms. A model is presented relating the evolution of genomic GC content over time to AT [Formula: see text] GC and GC [Formula: see text] AT mutation rates. By employing Itô calculus it is shown that if mutation rates are subject to random perturbations, that can vary over time, several implications follow. In particular, an extra Brownian motion term appears influencing genomic nucleotide variability; the greater the random perturbations the more genomic nucleotide variability. This can have several interpretations depending on the context. For instance, reducing the influence of the random perturbations on the AT/GC mutation rates and thus genomic nucleotide variability, to limit fitness decreasing and deleterious mutations, will likely suggest channeling of resources. On the other hand, increased genomic nucleotide diversity may be beneficial in variable environments. In asexually reproducing organisms, the Brownian motion term can be considered to be inversely reflective of the selective pressures an organism is subjected to at the molecular level. The presented model is a generalization of a previous model, limited to microbial symbionts, to all asexually reproducing, non-recombining organisms. Last, a connection between the presented model and the classical Luria-Delbrück mutation model is presented in an Itô calculus setting.\n",
      "Many short-read genome assemblies have been found to be incomplete and contain mis-assemblies. The Vertebrate Genomes Project has been producing new reference genome assemblies with an emphasis on being as complete and error-free as possible, which requires utilizing long reads, long-range scaffolding data, new assembly algorithms, and manual curation. A more thorough evaluation of the recent references relative to prior assemblies can provide a detailed overview of the types and magnitude of improvements.\n",
      "Large scale DNA oligo pools are emerging as a novel material in a variety of advanced applications. However, GC content and length cause significant bias in amplification of oligos. We systematically explored the amplification of one oligo pool comprising of over ten thousand distinct strands with moderate GC content in the range of 35-65%. Uniqual amplification of oligos result to the increased Gini index of the oligo distribution while a few oligos greatly increased their proportion after 60 cycles of PCR. However, the significantly enriched oligos all have relatively high GC content. Further thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that a high value of both GC content and Gibbs free energy could improve the replication of specific oligos during biased amplification. Therefore, this double-G (GC content and Gibbs free energy) driven replication advantage can be used as a guiding principle for the sequence design for a variety of applications, particularly for data storage.\n",
      "The 45S rDNA is considered the most useful chromosomal marker for cytogenetic analysis of Passiflora. Amplification of 45S rDNA sequence via PCR are more advantageous than sequence maintenance in vectors for chromosomal hybridization via FISH. We aimed both to identify 45S rDNA by sequencing data for chromosomal localization and to verify the relationship between GC content and CMA<sub>3</sub>/DAPI banding.\n",
      "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming the new standard for bacterial high-resolution typing and the performance of laboratories is being evaluated in interlaboratory comparisons. The use of the Illumina Nextera XT library preparation kit has been found to be associated with poorer performance due to a GC-content-dependent coverage bias. The bias is especially strong when sequencing low GC-content species. Here, we have made an in-depth analysis of the Nextera XT coverage bias problem using data from a proficiency test of the low GC-content species <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>. We have compared Nextera XT with Nextera Flex/DNA Prep and examined the consequences on downstream WGS analysis when using different quantities of raw data. We have also analyzed how the coverage bias relates to differential usage of tagmentation cleavage sites. We found that the tagmentation site was characterized by a symmetrical motif with a central AT-rich region surrounded by Gs and Cs. The Gs and Cs appeared to be the main determinant for cleavage efficiency and the genomic regions that were associated with low coverage only contained low-efficiency cleavage sites. This explains why low GC-content genomes and regions are more subjected to coverage bias. We furthermore extended our analysis to other datasets representing other bacterial species. We visualized how the coverage bias was large in low GC-content species such as <i>C. jejuni</i>, <i>C. coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, whereas species with neutral GC-content such as <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> were only affected in certain regions. Species with high GC-content such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> were hardly affected at all. The coverage bias associated with Nextera XT was not found when Nextera Flex/DNA Prep had been used.\n",
      "Short hairpin RNAs, or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), are a proven tool for gene knockdown and a promising therapeutic approach for suppression of disease-associated genes. The efficient preparation of shRNA-expressing vectors can sometimes become a bottleneck due to the complexity of shRNA hairpin sequence and structure, especially for repetitive or high GC-content targets. Here, we present improved shRNA cloning and validation methods that enabled efficient and rapid cloning of several shRNAs targeting disease-associated repeat expansions, including GGGGCC, CAG, CTG, CCTG, and CGG into modified pLKO.1 vectors. Improvements included shRNA insert design and preparation, recombination-based cloning, and sequencing-based validation that included Sanger and nanopore long-read sequencing. This improved method should enable practical, efficient cloning of nearly any shRNA sequence.\n",
      "Multiple synonymous codons code for the same amino acid, resulting in the degeneracy of the genetic code and in the preferred used of some codons called codon bias usage (CBU). We performed a large-scale analysis of codon usage bias analysing the distribution of the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the codon relative adaptiveness index (RA) in 4868 bacterial genomes. We found that CAI values differ significantly between protein functional domains and part of the protein outside domains and show how CAI, GC content and preferred usage of polymerase III alpha subunits are related. Additionally, we give evidence of the association between CAI and bacterial phenotypes.\n",
      "Genomic GC (Guanine-Cytosine) content is a fundamental molecular trait linked with many key genomic features such as codon and amino acid use. Across bacteria, GC content is surprisingly diverse and has been studied for many decades; yet its evolution remains incompletely understood. Since it is difficult to observe GC content evolve on laboratory time scales, phylogenetic comparative approaches are instrumental; but this dimension is rarely studied systematically in the case of bacterial GC content. We applied phylogenetic comparative models to analyze GC content evolution in multiple bacterial groups across 2 major bacterial phyla. We find that GC content diversifies via a combination of gradual evolution and evolutionary \"jumps.\" Surprisingly, unlike prior reports that solely focused on reductions in GC, we found a comparable number of jumps with both increased and decreased GC content. Overall, many of the identified jumps occur in lineages beyond the well-studied peculiar examples of endosymbiotic and AT-rich marine bacteria and do not support the predicted role of oxygen dependence. Our analysis of rapid and large shifts in GC content thus identifies new clades and novel contexts to further understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of this important genomic trait.\n",

      "The nucleosome is the basic structural element of genomic DNA packaging and plays a role in transcription, replication, and recombination. Poly(dA) tracts are considered major sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning, although their role is not well understood. Here, we show that the homopolymeric character and the low GC content of poly(dA)s play different roles in nucleosome formation. We found that the inherent low GC content of poly(dA) alone can account for the deep and anisotropic nucleosome depletion at structurally and functionally important regions of promoters and origins of replication. We also show that the level of nucleosome occupancy at poly(dA) is strongly related to the local nucleotide background and its high frequency of occurrence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not appear merely to be associated with its intrinsic nucleosome-excluding properties. In addition, we show that the GC content alone can predict more than 60% of the in vitro nucleosome map, providing further evidence that the intrinsic nucleosome positioning is more greatly determined by GC content than poly(dA) stretches. Our results are consistent with a model in which poly(dA) stretches act at two distinct levels: first, by its low GC content, which intrinsically contributes to hinder nucleosome formation, and second, by its contiguous runs of dA that selectively drive the recruitment of non-histone proteins with structural and functional roles.\n",
      "Eukaryotic genes are interrupted by introns that must be accurately spliced from mRNA precursors. With an average length of 25 nt, the more than 90,000 introns of <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i> stand among the shortest introns reported in eukaryotes. The mechanisms specifying the correct recognition of these tiny introns remain poorly understood. Splicing can occur cotranscriptionally, and it has been proposed that chromatin structure might influence splice site recognition. To investigate the roles of nucleosome positioning in intron recognition, we determined the nucleosome occupancy along the <i>P. tetraurelia</i> genome. We show that <i>P. tetraurelia</i> displays a regular nucleosome array with a nucleosome repeat length of ∼151 bp, among the smallest periodicities reported. Our analysis has revealed that introns are frequently associated with inter-nucleosomal DNA, pointing to an evolutionary constraint favoring introns at the AT-rich nucleosome edge sequences. Using accurate splicing efficiency data from cells depleted for nonsense-mediated decay effectors, we show that introns located at the edge of nucleosomes display higher splicing efficiency than those at the center. However, multiple regression analysis indicates that the low GC content of introns, rather than nucleosome positioning, is associated with high splicing efficiency. Our data reveal a complex link between GC content, nucleosome positioning, and intron evolution in <i>Paramecium</i>.\n",
      "GC pairs are generally more stable than AT pairs; GC-rich genomes were proposed to be more adapted to high temperatures than AT-rich genomes. Previous studies consistently showed positive correlations between growth temperature and the GC contents of structural RNA genes. However, for the whole genome sequences and the silent sites of the codons in protein-coding genes, the relationship between GC content and growth temperature is in a long-lasting debate.\n",
      "Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is a small round blue cell tumor and is the second most frequent pediatric bone cancer. 85% of EwS tumors express the fusion oncoprotein EWS-FLI1, the product of a t(11;22) reciprocal translocation. Prior work has indicated that transcription regulation alone does not fully describe the oncogenic capacity of EWS-FLI1, nor does it provide an effective means to stratify patient tumors. Research using EwS cell lines and patient samples has suggested that EWS-FLI1 also disrupts mRNA biogenesis. In this work we both describe the underlying characteristics of mRNA that are aberrantly spliced in EwS tumor samples as well as catalogue mRNA splicing events across other pediatric tumor types. Here, we also use short- and long-read sequencing to identify <i>cis</i>-factors that contribute to splicing profiles we observe in Ewing sarcoma. Our analysis suggests that GC content upstream of cassette exons is a defining factor of mRNA splicing in EwS. We also describe specific splicing events that discriminate EwS tumor samples from the assumed cell of origin, human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (hMSC-BM). Finally, we identify specific splicing factors PCBP2, RBMX, and SRSF9 by motif enrichment and confirm findings from tumor samples in EwS cell lines.\n",
      "The frequency of G and C nucleotides in genomes varies from species to species, and sometimes even between different genes in the same genome. The monocot grasses have a bimodal distribution of genic GC content absent in dicots. We categorized plant genes from 5 dicots and 4 monocot grasses by synteny to related species and determined that syntenic genes have significantly higher GC content than non-syntenic genes at their 5`-end in the third position within codons for all 9 species. Lower GC content is correlated with gene duplication, as lack of synteny to distantly related genomes is associated with past interspersed gene duplications. Two mutation types can account for biased GC content, mutation of methylated C to T and gene conversion from A to G. Gene conversion involves non-reciprocal exchanges between homologous alleles and is not detectable when the alleles are identical or heterozygous for presence-absence variation, both likely situations for genes duplicated to new loci. Gene duplication can cause production of siRNA which can induce targeted methylation, elevating mC→T mutations. Recently duplicated plant genes are more frequently methylated and less likely to undergo gene conversion, each of these factors synergistically creating a mutational environment favoring AT nucleotides. The syntenic genes with high GC content in the grasses compose a subset that have undergone few duplications, or for which duplicate copies were purged by selection. We propose a \"biased gene duplication / biased mutation\" (BDBM) model that may explain the origin and trajectory of the observed link between duplication and genic GC bias. The BDBM model is supported by empirical data based on joint analyses of 9 angiosperm species with their genes categorized by duplication status, GC content, methylation levels and functional classes.\n",
      "We determined various forces involved in shaping codon usage of the genes linked to brain iron accumulation and infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. The analysis paved the way for determining the forces responsible for composition, expression level, physical properties and codon bias of a gene. An interesting observation related to composition was that, on all the three codon positions, any two of the four nucleotides had similar compositions. CpG, TpA, and GpT dinucleotides were underrepresented with the overrepresentation of TpG dinucleotide. CpG and TpA containing codons ATA, CTA, TCG, and GCG were underrepresented, while TpG dinucleotide containing codon CTG was overrepresented, indicative of compositional constraints importance. GC ending codons were favored when the genome is GC rich, except leucine encoding codon TTG, which exhibits an inverse relationship with GC content. Nucleotide disproportions are found associated with the physical properties of proteins. The values of CAI and ENc are suggestive of low codon bias in genes. Considering the results of neutrality analysis, parity analysis, underrepresentation of TpA and CpG codons, and over-representation of TpG codons, the correlation between the compositional constraints and skew relationships with protein properties suggested the role of all the three selectional, mutational and compositional forces in shaping codon usage with the dominance of selectional pressure.\n",
      "In the present study, the results of nucleotide composition analysis showed that the legume chloroplast (cp) transcriptomes were AT rich. From the neutrality plot, we observed that natural selection might have played a major role, while mutation pressure played a minor role in the CUB of cp transcriptomes. Highly significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation was found between mRNA free energy (mFE) and scaled chi-square for entire mRNA in Cicer arietinum and Lens culinaris suggesting that the release of higher energy by entire mRNA molecule might be associated with higher degree of codon usage bias in these two crop plants. Further, highly significant (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) positive correlation of mFE for entire mRNA was found with GC3 and that of mFE for 39 bases with GC, GC1, GC2 and GC3 contents among all the legumes. This indicated that higher GC content might induce the release of more free energy by cp transcriptomes.\n",
      "The evolution of the GC (guanine cytosine) content at the third codon position of the histone genes (<i>H1</i>, <i>H2A</i>, <i>H2B</i>, <i>H3</i>, <i>H4</i>, <i>H2AvD</i>, <i>H3.3A</i>, <i>H3.3B</i>, and <i>H4r</i>) in 12 or more <i>Drosophila</i> species is reviewed. For explaining the evolution of the GC content at the third codon position of the genes, a model assuming selection with a deleterious effect for adenine/thymine and a size effect is presented. The applicability of the model to whole-genome genes is also discussed.\n",
