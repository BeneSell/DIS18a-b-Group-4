We plan to extract the GC-Content percentage within different studies from pubmed. The studies are about different bacteria (for example escherichia coli). The GC-Content percentages should be transfered to ORKG.

Example of a study having gc-content percentage in abstract: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3288121/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056994/)
In this case 44.57% GC content would be transfered to ORKG.
