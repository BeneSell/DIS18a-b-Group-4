## Introduction

Welcome to our Project! 

Certainly! Bacteria are a diverse group of microorganisms that play a significant role in various ecosystems, including soil, water, and the human body. One essential characteristic used to study and classify bacteria is their GC content. The GC content is an important parameter in bacterial genomics because it can provide insights into the organism's evolutionary history, genome stability, and adaptation to different environments. Bacteria with higher GC content often have more stable genomes and may exhibit greater resistance to environmental changes.

## Getting startet

We plan to extract the GC-Content percentage within different studies from pubmed. The studies are about different bacteria. The GC-Content percentages should be transfered to ORKG.
The plan is to write a python code which will focus on generating information from pubmed. This can be made with different libraries such as bio.entrez! We aimed to receive a hand full of bacteria with their gc-content as well as a short discription of the bacterium, to have a proper comparison later on. To be able to load the information in ORKG we will have to get the DOI number of the paper where we get the data from.
The python must result a csv file with the mentioned information to publish it on ORKG.

## Example

As you can see in the following link, there is the bacterium Escherichia coli mentioned and a gc content of 44.57% (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056994/).
Our code has to detect these information as well as the header, which mostly contains a discription, and safe it in a csv file. This should be done with multiple papers.

The final view should look like following, just with bacterial data.

## FAQ

What are the verification steps to be able to upload data to ORKG?
Which library do we use to get website data?
How do we generate discriptions for the bacteria?
How do we want to show our results?
Are there multiple fields of applications for this project?
