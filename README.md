## Introduction

Welcome to our Project! 

## Getting startet

We plan to extract the GC-Content percentage within different studies from pubmed. The studies are about different bacteria. The GC-Content percentages should be transfered to ORKG.

## Example

Example of a study having gc-content percentage in abstract: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3288121/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056994/)
In this case 44.57% GC content would be transfered to ORKG.

The plan is to write a python code which will focus on generating information from pubmed. This can be made with different libraries such as beautifulsoup. We aimed to receive a hand full of bacteria with their gc-content as well as a short discription of the bacterium, to have a proper comparison later on. To be able to load the information in ORKG we will have to get the DOI number of the paper where we get the data from. 


The final view with our bacterial information should look like following.
