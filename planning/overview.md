- **database linkage and integration**: you could link ORKG with other relevant databases except PubMed to collect more comprehensive information.
  
- **user interface**: Develop a user-friendly web application or interface to facilitate access to the extracted GC content data. This would allow other users, such as researchers, biologists, etc., to access the data and use it for their own analyses.
- **comparison of the results with other data sets**: After extraction, the results can also be compared with other data sources to determine correlation or discrepancies. In this way, the project can be further improved.
- **meta-analysis and data integration**: merge extracted data, perform meta-analysis to be able to identify patterns, structures or trends in GC content. This could lead to a more comprehensive view of GC content and its importance.
- **machine learning or AI**: train machine learning methods/AI to be able to extract GC content in a more automated and accurate way.
- **data mining and Big Data analysis**: leverage additional data sources, such as publicly available genomic databases, to analyze GC content on a larger scale for more comprehensive and representative insights.
- **feed results into knowledge graphs other than ORKG or other databases**: The analysis results, which are extracted from PubMed, could be fed into platforms other than ORKG.
